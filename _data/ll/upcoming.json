It is used to transport cargo to the ISS.\r\n\r\nThe first operational mission of Cygnus to the ISS was in September 2013.\r\n\r\nOne flight on 28 October 2014 ended in a failure when the Antares launch vehicle, used to launch the Cygnus, exploded shortly after launch. This set back the Cygnus launch schedule over a year. Following the launch anomaly a new version known as 'Cygnus Enhanced' was flown. This extended the Cygnus length and allowed it to carry an extra 700kg to the ISS.",
