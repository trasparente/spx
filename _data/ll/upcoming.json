In late 2002, a new US$301 million contract was awarded to Boeing as part of NASA's Space Launch Initiative framework.\r\n\r\nThe X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on 13 September 2004. Thereafter, the program became a classified project. DARPA promoted the X-37 as part of the independent space policy that the United States Department of Defense has pursued since the 1986 Challenger disaster.",
