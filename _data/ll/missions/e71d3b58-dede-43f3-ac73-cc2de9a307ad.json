They will perform tests on Crew Dragon in addition to conducting research and other tasks with the space station crew. \n\nAs the final flight test for SpaceX, this mission will validate the company’s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities. This also will be the first time NASA astronauts will test the spacecraft systems in orbit. The Demo-2 mission will be the final major step before NASA’s Commercial Crew Program certifies Crew Dragon for operational, long-duration missions to the space station.\n\nCurrent Mission Status:\nAfter a successful ride to orbit and stay at the International Space Station, the Dragon Spacecraft successfully made its way back to Earth.
