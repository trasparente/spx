Liftoff from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center is scheduled at 10:39 p.m. EST (0339 UTC). It will be the 100th launch this year from the spaceport at Cape Canaveral. The first-stage booster for this mission, B1080, making its 23rd flight will land on SpaceX's drone ship 'Just Read the Instructions', stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe missions, designated Starlink 6-78, will take a south-easterly trajectory on departure from Florida's Space Coast.\n\nOur live coverage with commentary will start about one hour prior to the first launch.\n\nVideos like this are made possible by the support of our members.
