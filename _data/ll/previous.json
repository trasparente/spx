This set back the Cygnus launch schedule over a year. Following the launch anomaly a new version known as 'Cygnus Enhanced' was flown. This extended the Cygnus length and allowed it to carry an extra 700kg to the ISS.",

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.
